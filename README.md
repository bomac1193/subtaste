# Subtaste

**The psychometric taste intelligence platform that knows who you are, not just what you clicked.**

## The Diagnosis

The content discovery industry is fundamentally broken.

**The core problem**: Current recommendation systems optimize for engagement metrics (clicks, watch time, shares) rather than genuine taste alignment. This creates a cascade of failures:

1. **Algorithmic Homogenization** - Platforms push users toward the same viral content, collapsing taste diversity into a narrow band of "safe" recommendations
2. **Engagement ≠ Satisfaction** - High engagement often correlates with anxiety, FOMO, and content regret—not genuine enjoyment
3. **Identity Blindness** - Systems model behavior without understanding the person behind it. They know you watched something; they don't know why
4. **Cross-Modal Fragmentation** - Your music app doesn't know your visual taste. Your fashion feed doesn't know your sonic preferences. Each platform builds an incomplete silhouette
5. **Subculture Erasure** - Emerging aesthetic movements get flattened into mainstream-adjacent categories, killing the very niches that drive cultural evolution

The result: billions spent on recommendation engines that make users feel increasingly unseen, manipulated, and aesthetically adrift.

## What Subtaste Solves

Subtaste builds a **unified taste identity** by combining psychometric profiling with behavioral learning across content types.

Instead of asking "what content will keep them scrolling?", we ask: **"Who is this person, and what would genuinely resonate with their aesthetic DNA?"**

### The Multi-Layer Taste System

1. **Psychometric Layer** - Big Five personality traits + extended taste-relevant dimensions (novelty seeking, aesthetic sensitivity, risk tolerance)
2. **Aesthetic Layer** - Visual preferences (darkness, complexity, organic vs. synthetic) and music preferences (tempo, energy, acoustic vs. digital)
3. **Constellation Layer** - 27 archetypal taste profiles that map psychometric traits to aesthetic expressions
4. **Behavioral Layer** - Continuous learning from swipe interactions, dwell time, and explicit ratings

A user isn't just "likes dark electronic music." They're **Nycataria**—nocturnal, urban-drawn, finding clarity after midnight, with specific trait expressions that predict their response to imagery, fashion, and AI-generated artifacts alike.

## Guiding Policy

**We optimize for taste coherence, not engagement addiction.**

### Core Principles

- **Identity First**: Understand the person before recommending content
- **Cross-Modal Unity**: One taste profile works across images, music, and AI artifacts
- **Subculture Preservation**: Detect and amplify emerging aesthetic movements before they're diluted
- **Psychometric Grounding**: Build on validated psychological science, not pure behavioral correlation
- **Transparent Scoring**: Users see why content matches (or doesn't) their profile

### Competitive Strengths

| Traditional Recommenders | Subtaste |
|-------------------------|----------|
| Optimize for engagement metrics | Optimize for taste alignment |
| Behavioral-only signals | Psychometric + aesthetic + behavioral fusion |
| Single-modal (music OR images OR video) | Cross-modal unified profile |
| Reactive (based on past clicks) | Predictive (based on identity) |
| Homogenizing effect | Subculture-preserving |
| Black box scoring | Interpretable constellation mapping |

## Strategy & Objectives

### Strategic Divergence

Rather than competing on the same axes as existing platforms (more data, faster algorithms, bigger content libraries), Subtaste diverges on **what we optimize for**:

- **Eliminate**: Engagement-maximizing dark patterns, infinite scroll addiction loops
- **Reduce**: Cold-start problem (quiz provides immediate signal), content anxiety
- **Raise**: Taste self-awareness, cross-modal discovery, subculture connection
- **Create**: Psychometric taste identity, constellation archetypes, early-adopter detection

### Primary Objectives

1. **Build the Taste Graph** - Create the most accurate cross-modal taste profiling system using psychometric science + aesthetic feature mapping

2. **Enable Subculture Discovery** - Detect emerging aesthetic clusters before mainstream recognition, connecting early adopters to their nascent communities

### Key Metrics

- **Subtaste Index**: Measures coherence/distinctiveness of user taste (0-100)
- **Explorer Score**: How actively users seek new experiences
- **Early Adopter Score**: Tendency to discover trends before mainstream adoption
- **Cross-Modal Hit Rate**: Accuracy of predictions across content types

## Revolutionary Value Offering

### For Users

- **Know Yourself**: Discover your constellation and understand your aesthetic DNA
- **Find Your People**: Connect with others who share your specific taste profile, not just surface-level genre preferences
- **Cross-Modal Discovery**: Love a track? Find images, fashion, and AI art that resonates with the same taste vector
- **Escape the Algorithm**: Content scored by genuine alignment, not engagement manipulation

### For Creators & Brands

- **Psychographic Targeting**: Reach audiences by taste identity, not just demographics
- **Subculture Intelligence**: Identify emerging movements and their aesthetic signatures
- **Cross-Modal Campaigns**: Design experiences that resonate across visual, sonic, and symbolic dimensions

### For the Ecosystem

- **Preserve Taste Diversity**: Counter algorithmic homogenization by amplifying niche aesthetics
- **Validate Subcultures**: Give emerging movements data-backed identity before they're diluted
- **Bridge Modalities**: Enable discovery across content types that currently exist in siloed platforms

## Market Positioning Through Divergence

Subtaste doesn't compete in the crowded "better recommendations" space. We create a new category: **Taste Intelligence**.

| Axis | Industry Standard | Subtaste Position |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Signal Source | Clicks, views, time | Psychometrics + aesthetics + behavior |
| Output | "You might like..." | "This is who you are" |
| Scope | Single platform/modality | Cross-modal identity |
| User Relationship | Passive consumer | Active self-discovery |
| Cultural Effect | Homogenization | Subculture amplification |

We're not building a better recommendation engine. We're building the **identity layer for taste**—the system that understands aesthetic preference at a level current platforms can't reach because they're optimizing for the wrong objective function.

## The 27 Constellations

Each constellation represents a coherent taste archetype with specific psychometric profiles, visual signatures, and sonic preferences:

**Somnexis** · **Nycataria** · **Holovain** · **Obscyra** · **Holofern** · **Prismant** · **Luminth** · **Crysolen** · **Nexyra** · **Velocine** · **Astryde** · **Noctyra** · **Glemyth** · **Vireth** · **Chromyne** · **Opalith** · **Fluxeris** · **Glovern** · **Vantoryx** · **Silquor** · **Iridrax** · **Prismora** · **Lucidyne** · **Velisynth** · **Aurivox** · **Glaceryl** · **Radianth**

Users are mapped to a primary constellation with blend weights showing affinity across all archetypes—enabling both clear identity ("You are Somnexis") and nuanced scoring through the full constellation spectrum.
